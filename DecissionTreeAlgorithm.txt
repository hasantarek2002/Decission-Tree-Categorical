if the sub-table passed to the algorithm is empty
    return NULL;    // since there is no data in the table
if the sub-table passed to the algorithm is homogeneous (if all the rows have the same value for the last column)
    mark this node as a leaf node;
    label this node with the value of the last column
    return a pointer to this node
else
    decide a column to split the table on based on information gain
    set the node's splitOn value to this column's name
    for all the values that the splitting column can take:
        create a new node
        set the new node as the current node's child node
        prune the sub-table so that all the rows with this value of the last column are removed
        recursively call the function by passing it the new pruned table and the new node
